# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/font/Nunito/
    - assets/font/Roboto/
    - assets/png/
    - assets/json/naomarvinjr-kf9q-57c489811c16.json
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family:  CustomIcon
      fonts:
      - asset: assets/font/CustomIcon.ttf

    - family: Roboto
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto/Roboto-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Roboto/Roboto-Italic.ttf
          style: italic

    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito/Nunito-Black.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Nunito/Nunito-BlackItalic.ttf
          style: italic
    
    - family: Rubik
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/font/Rubik/Rubik-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/font/Rubik/Rubik-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
